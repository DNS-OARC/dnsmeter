Description: DNS performance and infrastructure testing
 DNSMeter is a tool for testing performance of nameserver and/or
 infrastructure around it.
 It generates dns queries and sends them via UDP to a target nameserver
 and counts the answers.
 .
 Features:
 - payload can be given as text file or pcap file
 - can automatically run different load steps, which can be given as
   list or ranges
 - results per load step can be stored in CSV file
 - sender address can be spoofed from a given network or from pcap file,
   if payload is a pcap file
 - answers are counted, even if source address is spoofed, if answers get
   routed back to the load generator
 - roundtrip-times are measured (average, min, mix)
 - amount of DNSSEC queries can be given as percentage of total traffic
 - optimized for high amount of packets. On an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2430
   v2 @ 2.50GHz it can generate more than 900.000 packets per second
